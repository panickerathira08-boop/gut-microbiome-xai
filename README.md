Explainable AI for Gut Microbiome–Disease Relationship Analysis

(Research-Oriented Academic Project)

📌 About This Project

This repository contains the development of an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) framework to investigate the relationship between gut microbiome composition and disease conditions, with a focus on identifying potential associations between colorectal cancer (CRC) and diabetes.
The objective is to combine machine learning–based prediction with model interpretability techniques to better understand biologically meaningful microbial patterns linked to disease.

🎯 Project Objective

- Analyze microbiome feature data to detect disease-related patterns
- Building the predictive machine learning models for disease association
- Use explainability methods like SHAP to interpret the model decisions 

🧠 My Contribution

- Data preprocessing, normalization, and feature preparation for microbiome datasets
- Implemented machine learning classification models for disease prediction
- Applied SHAP and LIME explainability techniques to interpret feature importance
- Investigated the possible associations between CRC and diabetes
